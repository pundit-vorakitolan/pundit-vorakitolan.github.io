            <h3>Optimization Algorithm for a Satellite Antenna Array</h3>
            <p>
                In applications such as space-based weather radiometry, reflectarrays are an attractive alternative to traditional phased array antennas.
                In addition to their lower size, weight, and power requirements, it is possible to achieve higher gain and resolution by increasing the
                number of elements in the reflectarray. The Configurable Reflectarray for Electronic Wideband Scanning Radiometry (CREWSR), in development
                at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, is one such example of a large reflectarray. CREWSR's three interleaving element lattices each contain 120,000 to 480,000
                elements (connected to separate reflective 4-bit phase shifters), that enable independent beamsteering on each band. However, the inherent
                size of CREWSR and other very large reflectarrays present a challenge in implementing optimization and synthesis procedures.
            </p>
            <p>
                Widely used optimization and synthesis algorithms were designed for much smaller arrays; computation burden tends to scale dramatically
                as the number of array elements increase. In addition, reflectarrays are restricted to phase-only synthesis -- each of CREWSR's lattices
                are illuminated by separate horn antennas -- which limits the algorithms that can be used. For these reasons, these algorithms tend to be
                computationally impractical for large reflectarrays.
            </p>
            <p>
                I designed and implemented an algorithm to quickly sythesize element excitations for very large reflectarrays by exploiting properties of
                the Fourier transform. Applying this method to CREWSR, I was able to increase beam efficiency from 89% to 93% in a matter of seconds, not weeks or months.
